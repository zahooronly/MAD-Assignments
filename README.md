Charitable initiatives
Saylani, since its inception, has worked on both, providing needed economic and nutritional help to the needy in distress as well as providing means for able persons to earn a living through innovative solutions to "tackle the root causes and effects of poverty of Pakistani citizens." This ranges anywhere from programs similar to those provided by Social Security in Western nations to doing area to area and neighborhood to neighborhood search of the needy and providing relief.
Notable among these programs are:

**Roti Bank**

The Roti Bank provides free meals to needy families in a simple walk-up kiosk along a main thoroughfare in Karachi. After providing their identification, details of family size (via birth certificates) and getting the Saylani "Free Food Card", the families can get 2 meals per day for a month. The initiative was launched on 14 August 2018.

**Economic empowerment**

In 2013, in an effort to create economic empowerment via training in Technology, especially Web and Mobile App development, Saylani Welfare International Trust began its Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT) Program. Under the guidance of Zia Ullah Khan,[citation needed] who have previously ran successful mass IT programs like “Operation Badar”.

**Goal of SMIT**

The goal of SMIT was to create 10,000 well-trained **Web and Mobile App developers** in emerging programming languages like **React, Node JS and Angular JS**. The program thus far have trained **4,000** developers successfully in as varied a fields as **Cisco’s CCNA certification, Graphic Design, and Startup Entrepreneurship** along with the **Web and Mobile App development skills** to spur economic empowerment and allow its graduates to quickly become economically independent.

**Aid to Syrian and Rohingya refugees**

In 2017, Saylani Welfare Trust confirmed that they were providing food aid to Syrian refugees on Turkey's border with Syria. The Chief Operating Officer of Saylani, Muhammad Ghazal, said that they are working in partnership with the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) to provide aid to Syrian living in refugee camps near the border.

Saylani Welfare Trust also provides aid to Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

**COVID-19 crisis**

During the COVID-19 crisis, Saylani Welfare Trust provided free oxygen, food, rescue equipment and other supplies to hospitals and Covid-19 wards in the country. It also introduced mobile phone application and telephone service, where needy families can register themselves to get ration and other essential items.

On 13 April 2020, reports emerged that rations were being denied to minority Hindus and Christians in the coastal areas of Karachi by Saylani Welfare workers. On 14 April 2020, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) expressed concern regarding the reports about discrimination against the minorities in Karachi. Following the reports about Hindus and Christians in some parts of Karachi being denied food aid, other organisations such as the Edhi Foundation, JDC Welfare Organization and Jamaat-e-Islami stepped forward to provide rations to the minorities in those areas...
